###You are given two numbers L and R. You need to find all number in [L, R] such that choosed number is divisible by its digit.

###Note: If number has zero digit (like 102), you can ignore divisibility check for zero.

**Constraint:**
1 <= L < R <= 10^6

**Test Case 1:**

***Input:***
> 3 14

***Output:***
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

**Explanation:**
13 is not divisible by 3
14 is not divisible by 4
