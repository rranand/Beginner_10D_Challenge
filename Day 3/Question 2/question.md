###You are given two numbers L and R. You need to find all number in [L, R] such that choosed number is divisible by all its digit.

`Note: If number has zero digit (like 102), you can ignore divisibility check for zero.`

**Constraint:**<br />
1 <= L < R <= 10^6

**Test Case 1:**

***Input:***<br />
> 3 14

***Output:***<br />
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

**Explanation:**<br />
